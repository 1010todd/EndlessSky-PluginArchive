	description "This is two Argosies that, under the angry denial of wind and thunder (workshop ventilation and an arc welder, respectively), have been merged together with a bit of extra structural and engine space. It's actually a bit stronger than two separate Argosies thanks to the connecting bits, but it's slower and doesn't dissipate heat quite as well."
