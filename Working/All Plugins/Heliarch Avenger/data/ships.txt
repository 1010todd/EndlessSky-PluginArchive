	description `Even with all the resources and advancements the Heliarchs have, each of these colossal warships still takes them many years to build, due to the absurd amount of personnel required to keep watch over the engineering process, and the delicate process of gathering the materials used to construct their hull plating, found only in the innermost part of a planet's crust.`
	description `	When the Quarg returned with retribution in an attempt to reclaim their territory in Coalition space, the Heliarchs devised this ship, capable of beating down Quarg ships on it's own, without relying on stolen Quarg technology.`
