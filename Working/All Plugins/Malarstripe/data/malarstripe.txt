	description "Designed at the same time as its much larger cousin, the Malarstripe is a miniaturized Kestrel, designed to bring the high technology used in the Kestrel to the fighter playing field. It is one of the strongest fighters ever produced by humanity, carrying more weapons and shielding than any other."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."
